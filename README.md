### **GST Reconciliation Process in India**
GST reconciliation is the process of matching tax data across different GST returns to ensure accuracy and compliance. Businesses must reconcile their **sales, purchases, and tax credits** to avoid penalties and ensure proper tax filings.

#### **1. Key GST Returns Involved**
- **GSTR-1**: Contains details of outward supplies (sales).
- **GSTR-3B**: A summary return that includes tax liability and ITC claims.
- **GSTR-2B**: A system-generated statement showing eligible ITC based on supplier filings.
- **Invoice Management System (IMS)**: Helps businesses track invoices and match them with GST returns.

#### 2. Steps in GST Reconciliation
1. **Data Collection**: Gather invoices, purchase records, and GST filings.
2. **Matching ITC Claims**: Compare ITC in **GSTR-3B** with supplier-reported data in **GSTR-2B**.
3. **Identifying Discrepancies**:
   - Unclaimed ITC (missing invoices).
   - Excess ITC claims (overreported tax credits).
   - Vendor non-compliance (supplier not reporting transactions).
4. Corrections & Follow-ups:
   - Businesses must rectify errors before filing returns.
   - Follow up with vendors to ensure proper reporting.
5. **Final Submission**: Ensure reconciled data is correctly filed in GST returns.
